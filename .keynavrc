# The 'start' command alone is handled specially, in that any key sequence
# mapped to 'start' will be grabbed when keynav starts up so you can invoke it
# to activate keynav. The remaining keys are only recognized while keynav is
# active

# Use 'clear' to blow away any previous keybindings
clear

# Use 'daemonize' to background ourselves.
